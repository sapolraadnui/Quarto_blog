Hi all!

I am a Data Scientist with 5+ years of industry experience applying machine learning, statistical analysis, and Python-based analytics to large, complex datasets.

My background spans data science and applied geoscience, where I have worked extensively with high-dimensional, spatial, and temporal data. This experience has strengthened my ability to work end-to-end, from data preparation and feature engineering to model development, evaluation, and communicating insights that support decision-making.

In my role at PTT Exploration and Production (PTTEP), I have built reproducible data pipelines, applied supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, developed interactive dashboards, and led data enablement initiatives by training cross-functional teams in Python and data analytics.

While my domain experience includes geospatial and geoscience applications, my focus is on generalizable data science skills that translate across industries, including finance and technology.

I am currently pursuing a Master of Data Science (MDS) at the University of British Columbia (UBC) and am interested in Data Scientist roles focused on impactful, real-world analytics problems.
